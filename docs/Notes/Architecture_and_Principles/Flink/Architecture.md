Apache Flink is a framework and distributed processing engine for stateful computations over _unbounded and bounded_ data streams.
1.  **Unbounded streams** have a start but no defined end. They do not terminate and provide data as it is generated. Unbounded streams must be continuously processed, i.e., events must be promptly handled after they have been ingested. It is not possible to wait for all input data to arrive because the input is unbounded and will not be complete at any point in time. Processing unbounded data often requires that events are ingested in a specific order, such as the order in which events occurred, to be able to reason about result completeness.
    
2.  **Bounded streams** have a defined start and end. Bounded streams can be processed by ingesting all data before performing any computations. Ordered ingestion is not required to process bounded streams because a bounded data set can always be sorted. Processing of bounded streams is also known as batch processing.

#### Leverage In-Memory Performance

Stateful Flink applications are optimized for local state access. Task state is always maintained in memory or, if the state size exceeds the available memory, in access-efficient on-disk data structures. Hence, tasks perform all computations by accessing local, often in-memory, state yielding very low processing latencies. Flink guarantees exactly-once state consistency in case of failures by periodically and asynchronously checkpointing the local state to durable storage.
