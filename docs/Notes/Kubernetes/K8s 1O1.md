Kubernetes comprises a set of independent, composable control processes that continuously drive the current state towards the provided desired state. It shouldn't matter how you get from A to C. Centralized control is also not required. This results in a system that is easier to use and more powerful, robust, resilient, and extensible.

**K8s Components**

![[Kubernetes components.svg]]
* Control Plane
	* etcd : Consistent and highly-available key value store used as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data.(make sure you have a [back up](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/configure-upgrade-etcd/#backing-up-an-etcd-cluster) plan for those data.)
	* kube-Api server : It exposes the Kubernetes API, designed to scale horizontally. 
	* kube-scheduler : Control plane component that watches for newly created [Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) with no assigned [node](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/), and selects a node for them to run on.
	* kube-control-manager : Control plane component that runs [controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) processes. Logically, each [controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) is a separate process, but to reduce complexity, they are all compiled into a single binary and run in a single process.
	* cloud-controller-manager : The cloud-controller-manager only runs controllers that are specific to your cloud provider.
		* The following controllers can have cloud provider dependencies:
			* Node controller: For checking the cloud provider to determine if a node has been deleted in the cloud after it stops responding
			* Route controller: For setting up routes in the underlying cloud infrastructure
			* Service controller: For creating, updating and deleting cloud provider load balancers
* Worker Nodes
	* kubelet : An agent that runs on each [node](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/) in the cluster. It makes sure that [containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/) are running in a [Pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) defined in PodSpecs.
	*  kube-proxy : Network proxy that runs on each [node](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/) in your cluster.
	* Container runtime :  The container runtime is the software that is responsible for running containers.
*  [Addons](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#addons)
	* [DNS](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#dns) : Containers started by Kubernetes automatically include this DNS server in their DNS searches.
