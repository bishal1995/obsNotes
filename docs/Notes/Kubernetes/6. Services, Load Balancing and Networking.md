 Kubernetes imposes the following fundamental requirements on any networking implementation (barring any intentional network segmentation policies):
- pods can communicate with all other pods on any other [node](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/) without NAT. This is called the "IP-per-pod" model.
- agents on a node (e.g. system daemons, kubelet) can communicate with all pods on that node
Kubernetes networking addresses four concerns:
- Containers within a Pod [use networking to communicate](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/) via loopback.
- Cluster networking provides communication between different Pods.
- The [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) API lets you [expose an application running in Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/services/connect-applications-service/) to be reachable from outside your cluster.
    - [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) provides extra functionality specifically for exposing HTTP applications, websites and APIs.
- You can also use Services to [publish services only for consumption inside your cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service-traffic-policy/).

### Service
In Kubernetes , a service is a method for exposing a networking application that is running as one or more Pods in Your cluster, is an abstraction to help you expose groups of Pods over a network. The set of Pods targeted by a Service is usually determined by a [selector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/) that you define. 

##### Defining a service
For example, suppose you have a set of Pods that each listen on TCP port 80 and are labelled as `app.kubernetes.io/name=proxy`. You can define a Service to publish that TCP listener, Port definitions in Pods have names, and you can reference these names in the `targetPort` attribute of a Service.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: proxy
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:stable
    ports:
      - containerPort: 80
        name: http-web-svc

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: proxy
  ports:
  - name: name-of-service-port
    protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: http-web-svc
```

#####  Services without selectors[](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#services-without-selectors)

Services most commonly abstract access to Kubernetes Pods thanks to the selector, but when used with a corresponding set of [EndpointSlices](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/endpoint-slices/) objects and without a selector, the Service can abstract other kinds of backends, including ones that run outside the cluster.

For example:
- You want to have an external database cluster in production, but in your test environment you use your own databases.
- You want to point your Service to a Service in a different [Namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces) or on another cluster.
- You are migrating a workload to Kubernetes. While evaluating the approach, you run only a portion of your backends in Kubernetes.

##### Multi-port Services[](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#multi-port-services)
For some Services, you need to expose more than one port. Kubernetes lets you configure multiple port definitions on a Service object. When using multiple ports for a Service, you must give all of your ports names so that these are unambiguous. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: MyApp
  ports:
    - name: http
      protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 9376
    - name: https
      protocol: TCP
      port: 443
      targetPort: 9377
```
##### Service type[](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types)
For some parts of your application (for example, frontends) you may want to expose a Service onto an external IP address, one that's accessible from outside of your cluster.
Kubernetes Service types allow you to specify what kind of Service you want.

The available `type` values and their behaviors are:
[`ClusterIP`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#type-clusterip)
Exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP. Choosing this value makes the Service only reachable from within the cluster. This is the default that is used if you don't explicitly specify a `type` for a Service. You can expose the Service to the public internet using an [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) or a [Gateway](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/).
[`NodePort`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#type-nodeport)
Exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port (the `NodePort`). To make the node port available, Kubernetes sets up a cluster IP address, the same as if you had requested a Service of `type: ClusterIP`.
[`LoadBalancer`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer)
Exposes the Service externally using an external load balancer. Kubernetes does not directly offer a load balancing component; you must provide one, or you can integrate your Kubernetes cluster with a cloud provider.
[`ExternalName`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#externalname)
Maps the Service to the contents of the `externalName` field (for example, to the hostname `api.foo.bar.example`). The mapping configures your cluster's DNS server to return a `CNAME` record with that external hostname value. No proxying of any kind is set up.

### Ingress
An API object that manages external access to the services in a cluster, typically HTTP. Ingress may provide load balancing, SSL termination and name-based virtual hosting.
#### Prerequisite 
You must have an [Ingress controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers) to satisfy an Ingress. Only creating an Ingress resource has no effect.
You may need to deploy an Ingress controller such as [ingress-nginx](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/). You can choose from a number of [Ingress controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers).
A minimal Ingress resource example:  
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: minimal-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx-example
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /testpath
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: test
            port:
              number: 80
```
