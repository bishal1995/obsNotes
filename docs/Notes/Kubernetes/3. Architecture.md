* ## Nodes
	* A node may be a virtual or physical machine, depending on the cluster. Each node is managed by the [control plane](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/glossary/?all=true#term-control-plane) and contains the services necessary to run [Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/).The [components](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#node-components) on a node include the [kubelet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubelet), a [container runtime](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes), and the [kube-proxy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-proxy/).
	* [Management](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/#management)
		* There are two main ways to have Nodes added to the [API server](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#kube-apiserver):
			*  The kubelet on a node self-registers to the control plane
			* You (or another human user) manually add a Node object
	* Node Status
		*  [Addresses](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/#addresses) 
			* HostName : The hostname as reported by the node's kernel. Can be overridden via the kubelet `--hostname-override` parameter.
			* ExternalIP : Typically the IP address of the node that is externally routable (available from outside the cluster).
			* InternalIP : InternalIP: Typically the IP address of the node that is routable only within the cluster.
		-   [Conditions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/#condition) : The `conditions` field describes the status of all `Running` nodes.
		-   [Capacity and Allocatable](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/#capacity) : The fields in the capacity block indicate the total amount of resources that a Node has. The allocatable block indicates the amount of resources on a Node that is available to be consumed by normal Pods.
		-   [Info](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/#info) : 
	- Heartbeats
		- Sent by Kubernetes nodes, help your cluster determine the availability of each node, and to take action when failures are detected
			-  updates to the `.status` of a Node
			* [Lease](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/cluster-resources/lease-v1/) objects within the `kube-node-lease` [namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces). Each Node has an associated Lease object.Distributed systems often have a need for "leases", which provides a mechanism to lock shared resources and coordinate activity between nodes.In Kubernetes, the "lease" concept is represented by `Lease` objects in the `coordination.k8s.io` API group, which are used for system-critical capabilities like node heart beats and component-level leader election.
	- Node [controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
		- Is a Kubernetes control plane component that manages various aspects of nodes.
- ## Control Plane
	- ### Controllers
		- A _control loop_ is a non-terminating loop that regulates the state of a system.In Kubernetes, controllers are control loops that watch the state of your [cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/glossary/?all=true#term-cluster), then make or request changes where needed. Each controller tries to move the current cluster state closer to the desired state.
		*  [Controller pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/#controller-pattern)
			*  [Control via API server](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/#control-via-api-server) : 
			*  [Direct control](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/#direct-control) : Controllers that interact with external state find their desired state from the API server, then communicate directly with an external system to bring the current state closer in line.
		* Design
			* As a tenet of its design, Kubernetes uses lots of controllers that each manage a particular aspect of cluster state. Most commonly, a particular control loop (controller) uses one kind of resource as its desired state, and has a different kind of resource that it manages to make that desired state happen. For example, a controller for Jobs tracks Job objects (to discover new work) and Pod objects (to run the Jobs, and then to see when the work is finished). In this case something else creates the Jobs, whereas the Job controller creates Pods.
	* ### Cloud Controller Manager
		* The cloud controller manager lets you link your cluster into your cloud provider's API, and separates out the components that interact with that cloud platform from components that only interact with your cluster.
		* Responsibilities
			* Node Controller : The node controller is responsible for updating [Node](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/) objects when new servers are created in your cloud infrastructure.
			* Route Controller : The route controller is responsible for configuring routes in the cloud appropriately so that containers on different nodes in your Kubernetes cluster can communicate with each other.
			* Service Controller : The service controller interacts with your cloud provider's APIs to set up load balancers and other infrastructure components when you declare a Service resource that requires them.
