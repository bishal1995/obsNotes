Greedy Algorithm

A greedy algorithm is any [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) that follows the problem-solving [heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_(computer_science)) of making the locally optimal choice at each stage.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm#cite_note-NISTg-1) In many problems, a greedy strategy does not produce an optimal solution, but a greedy heuristic can yield locally optimal solutions that approximate a globally optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time.

  

Most problems for which they work will have two properties

-   Greedy choice property : We can make whatever choice seems best at the moment and then solve the subproblems that arise later. The choice made by a greedy algorithm may depend on choices made so far, but not on future choices or all the solutions to the subproblem. It iteratively makes one greedy choice after another, reducing each given problem into a smaller one. In other words, a greedy algorithm never reconsiders its choices. This is the main difference from [dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming), which is exhaustive and is guaranteed to find the solution. After every stage, dynamic programming makes decisions based on all the decisions made in the previous stage and may reconsider the previous stage's algorithmic path to the solution.
    
-   Optimal substructure : A problem is said to have optimal substructure if an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems.    

  
  

 For interview it is important to remember the patterns, as it hard to prove that the problem can be solved by greedy approach
