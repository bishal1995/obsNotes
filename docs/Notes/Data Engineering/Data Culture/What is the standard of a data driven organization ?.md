Let us start us on the way to answering our first question: what does it mean for an organization to be data-driven?
* **Prerequisite #1**: An organization must be collecting data.
* **Prerequisite #2**: Data must be accessible and queryable.
	* Joinable : The data must be in a form that can be joined to other enterprise data when necessary.e.g. : There must be a data-sharing culture within the organization so that data can be joined, such as combining customersâ€™ clickstream with their transactional history.
	* Shareable : Siloed data is always going to inhibit the scope of what can be achieved. When more data is available to more parts of a system, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.
	* Queryable : There must be appropriate tools to query and slice and dice the data. All reporting and analysis requires filtering, grouping, and aggregating data to reduce the large amounts of raw data into a smaller set of higher-level numbers that help our brains comprehend what is happening in a business.

| ----------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Information | a) What happened ?            | b)What is happening            | c) What will happen ?    |

| Insight     | d)How and why did it happen ? | e)What is the next best action | f) What is the best/     |

**Hallmarks of Data-Drivenness**
* A data-driven organization will almost certainly be choosing among future options or actions using a suite of weighted variables. Resources are always finite, and there are always pros and cons for different reasonable courses of action. One should gather data for each of the set of variables that are of concern or interest and determine weights among those to generate a final leading decision.
* A data-driven organization may be continuously testing. It might be A/B testing checkout flow on a website or testing email subject lines in a marketing campaign.
* A data-driven organization may be involved in predictive modeling, forecasting sales, stock prices, or company revenue, but importantly feeding the prediction errors and other learning back into the models to help improve them.

Treat data as first class citizer, Data must be presented to influence the Decision maker (No Decisions from guts should be taken). Data has to drive reports leading to deeper dives and analysis. A data-driven organisation will use data as critical evidence to help inform and influence strategy.
