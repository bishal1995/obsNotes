* Stateless Transformation
	* map() : A function for performing one to one mapping.
	* flapmap() : A `MapFunction` is suitable only when performing a one-to-one transformation: for each and every stream element coming in, `map()` will emit one transformed element. Otherwise, you will want to use `flatmap`
	* keyBy( ) : Partition a stream around one of its attributes, so that all events with the same value of that attribute are grouped together.
	* 
* Statefull Transformation : Features of state manged by Flink
	*  **local**: Flink state is kept local to the machine that processes it, and can be accessed at memory speed
	-   **durable**: Flink state is fault-tolerant, i.e., it is automatically checkpointed at regular intervals, and is restored upon failure
	-   **vertically scalable**: Flink state can be kept in embedded RocksDB instances that scale by adding more local disk
	-   **horizontally scalable**: Flink state is redistributed as your cluster grows and shrinks
	-   **queryable**: Flink state can be queried externally via the [Queryable State API](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.17/docs/dev/datastream/fault-tolerance/queryable_state/).
