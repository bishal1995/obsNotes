Data modelling
- OLTP ( Online transaction processing ) / Relational data modelling / ER Diagrams  - Optimises for low latency, low-volume queries
- OLAP ( Online analytical processing ) - Optimises for large Volume, Group By queries, minimises JOINs
	- Dimensional modelling
	- One Big table
- Master Data - Optimises for completeness of entity definition, deduped.

Steps
-> Prod database snapshot -> Master Data -> Olap Cubes -> Metrics


- Cumulative Table Design
	- 2 Dataframes ( yesterday and today )
	- FULL OUTER JOIN the two dataframe together
	- COALESCE values to keep everything around
	- Hang onto all history 
- Usage
	- Growth analytics
	- State transition tracking
- Strength
	- Historical analysis without shuffle
	- Easy transition analysis
- Drawbacks
	- Can only be backfilled sequentially 
	- Handling PII data can be a mess since deleted/inactive users get carried forward
