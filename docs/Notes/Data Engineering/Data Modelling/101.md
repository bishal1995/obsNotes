### What is data modelling ?
->  Well defined data models to store the data in a database (data warehouse) depending on the business requirements (mostly OLAP based systems)

##### Factor considering while data modelling
* Scope of business : There are several departments and diverse business functions around.
* Feasibility of the data granularity levels of filtering, aggregation, slicing, and dicing
* Starts with logical modelling across multi-platforms and an extensive-architecture approach, its enhanced performance, and scalability.
- Serving data for all types and different categories of consumers
    - [Data Scientist, Data Analysts, Downstream applications, API-based system, Data Sharing systems]
- Highly flexible deployment and decoupling approach for cost-effectiveness.
- Well-defined Data Governance model to support quality, visibility, availability security
- Streamlined Master Data Management and Data Catalogue and Curation to support functionally and technically.
- Perfect monitoring and tracking of the Data Linage from Source into Serving layer
- Ability to facilitate Batch, Real-Time analysis, and Lambda process of high-velocity, verity, and veracity data.
- Supports Analytics and Advanced Analytics components.
- Agile Delivery approach from Data modelling and delivering aspects to satisfy, their business model.

#### Stages of data modelling
-> It comprises of 3 stages, conceptual, logical and physical ,

#### Modelling techniques
* Relational data modelling
* Dimensional data modelling
* Data Vault modelling



##### Dimensional Data Modelling
* What is it ?
* Techniques
	* Star Schema
	* Snowflake Schema
* Approach
	* **Top-down approach** ~ Coined by Inmon
	* **Bottom-up approach** ~ Coined by Kimball


Data Mart

-> ETL and ELT
- ETL
	- Data is extracted, transformed and loaded into warehouse, schema has to be enforced
	- Two types
		- Full Load/ETL
		- Incremental/Delta ETL 
- ELT
	- 


Schema on Read Vs Schema on Write


Dimensional Modelling
- Fact table : Quantitative data related to business, For eg : In sales data scenario, fact table will have measures like sales amount, quantity sold, and profit and the foreign keys in the fact table would link to dimension tables such as data, product, and store etc.
	- Fact hold 2 type of data
		- Measures
		- Foreign key of dimension
	- Grain of fact table
	- Types of fact table
		- Transaction fact table :  This captures the individual business events or transactions at a detailed level.For eg :  a sale, transaction, customer order, service request etc
		- Periodic snapshot fact table : Stores aggregated data at specific interval or snapshots like daily, weekly, monthly. It represents the state of metrics or KPIs at a specific point in time providing a snapshot of business performance over time. Usually used for trend analysis.
		- Accumulating snapshot fact table : Tracks the progress of a process over time, it stores data related to specific process stages, and as the process progresses, new information is added to the fact table to reflect the current state. Usually used in process-oriented analysis.![[Screenshot from 2024-04-24 07-32-33.png]]
		- Fact-less fact table : These contains references to foreign keys only without any numeric measure. For example : Enrolment data : ( student_id , course_id , enrolment_date ) - It doesn't have any numeric measure
- Dimension table (Attributes) : Stores descriptive or textual data about business entities referred to as dimensions.They help organise and provide context to the measures or facts stored in fact tables.
	- Key characteristics
		- Descriptive attributes
		- Primary Key
		- No numeric data
		- Hierarchical Structure
		- Low cardinality
	- Types of dimension table
		- Conformed dimension : A dimension that has consistent and uniform attributed and definitions across all data marts within an organisation. It can be used seamlessly in different parts of a data warehouse. For eg : Date (Date,month,day,year,hour,minute,second,day_of_week,public_holiday,fiscal_period)
		- Junk Dimension : It consolidates multiple low-cardinality flags or attributed into a single table. For eg : Lets say there are 3 low cardinality dimension 
			- Promotion type : (discount, free_gift , buy_one_get_one)
			- Payment method : (cash, credit_card, debit_rard)
			- Purchase channel : (in_store, online, mobile_app)
				- Instead of creating separate dimension table for each of these attributes, we can create a junk dimension
					- junk_dimension
						- junk_key
						- promotion_type
						- payment_method
						- purchase_channel
		-  Degenerate dimension : It is derived from a fact table and does not have separate dimension table, used for grouping and aggregating facts.  For eg :  A sale fact table has the following columns
			- transaction_id ( degenerate dimension ) : a unique identifier for each sales transaction
			- product_key ( foreign key )
			- date_key ( foreign key )
			- sales_amount
			- quantity_sold
		- Role playing dimension : Role playing dimensions are dimensions that are used more than once in a fact table, each time with a different meaning or role. For eg : An order fact table with following columns, Here DateKey dimension is a role playing dimension
			- Order_date ( DateKey )
			- Ship_date ( DateKey )
			- Ship_date ( DateKey )
			- order_id
			- product_id
			- amount
		-  Slowly changing dimension : Slowly changing dimensions refer to how data in your data warehouse changes over time. Slowly changing dimensions have the same natural key but other data columns that may or may not change over time depending on the type of dimensions that it is.
			- Type 0 : Dimensions that never change. Like States, Date, Zipcode etc, 
			- Type 1 : Type 1 refers to data that is overwritten by new data without keeping a historical record of that old piece of data.
			- Type 2 :  Type 2 dimensions are always created as a new record. If a detail in the data changes, a new row will be added to the table with a new primary key. However, the natural key would remain the same in order to map a record change to one another. Type 2 dimensions are the most common approach to tracking historical records.
			- Type 3 : Type 3 dimensions track changes in a row by adding a new column. Instead of adding a new row with a new primary key like with type 2 dimensions, the primary key remains the same and an additional column is appended. This is good if you need your primary key ro remain unique and only have one record for each natural key. However, you can really only track one change in a record rather than multiple changes over time. E.g : et’s say your warehouse location is changing. Because you don’t expect the address of your warehouse to change more than once, you add a `current_address` column with the address of your new warehouse. You then change the original address column name to be `previous_address` and store your old address information.
			- Type 4 : Type 4 dimensions exist as records in two different tables- a current record table and a historical record table. All of the records that are active in a given moment will be in one table and then all of the records considered historical will exist in a separate history table. This is a great way of keeping track of records that have many changes over time.
