### What is data modelling ?
->  Well defined data models to store the data in a database (data warehouse) depending on the business requirements (mostly OLAP based systems)

##### Factor considering while data modelling
* Scope of business : There are several departments and diverse business functions around.
* Feasibility of the data granularity levels of filtering, aggregation, slicing, and dicing
* Starts with logical modelling across multi-platforms and an extensive-architecture approach, its enhanced performance, and scalability.
- Serving data for all types and different categories of consumers
    - [Data Scientist, Data Analysts, Downstream applications, API-based system, Data Sharing systems]
- Highly flexible deployment and decoupling approach for cost-effectiveness.
- Well-defined Data Governance model to support quality, visibility, availability security
- Streamlined Master Data Management and Data Catalogue and Curation to support functionally and technically.
- Perfect monitoring and tracking of the Data Linage from Source into Serving layer
- Ability to facilitate Batch, Real-Time analysis, and Lambda process of high-velocity, verity, and veracity data.
- Supports Analytics and Advanced Analytics components.
- Agile Delivery approach from Data modelling and delivering aspects to satisfy, their business model.

#### Stages of data modelling
-> It comprises of 3 stages, conceptual, logical and physical , reference : https://www.couchbase.com/blog/conceptual-physical-logical-data-models/

#### Modelling techniques
