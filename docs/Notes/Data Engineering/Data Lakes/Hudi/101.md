* #### What is Hudi ?
	* What it provides
		* Table abstraction on data lake
		* Transaction 
		* Efficient upserts.deletes
		* Advanced Indexes
		* Streaming Ingestion
		* Data compaction/clustering 
		* Concurrency
		* 

#### Concepts
* Timeline
	* At its core, Hudi maintains a `timeline` of all actions performed on the table at different `instants`, A Hudi instant consists of the following components
		*   `Instant action` : Type of action performed on the table
		-   `Instant time` : Instant time is typically a timestamp (e.g: 20190117010349), which monotonically increases in the order of action's begin time.
		-   `state` : current state of the instant
	- Hudi guarantees that the actions performed on the timeline are atomic & timeline consistent based on the instant time,Key action performed include
		-   `COMMITS` - A commit denotes an **atomic write** of a batch of records into a table.
		-   `CLEANS` - Background activity that gets rid of older versions of files in the table, that are no longer needed.
		-   `DELTA_COMMIT` - A delta commit refers to an **atomic write** of a batch of records into a MergeOnRead type table, where some/all of the data could be just written to delta logs.
		-   `COMPACTION` - Background activity to reconcile differential data structures within Hudi e.g: moving updates from row based log files to columnar formats. Internally, compaction manifests as a special commit on the timeline
		-   `ROLLBACK` - Indicates that a commit/delta commit was unsuccessful & rolled back, removing any partial files produced during such a write
		-   `SAVEPOINT` - Marks certain file groups as "saved", such that cleaner will not delete them. It helps restore the table to a point on the timeline, in case of disaster/data recovery scenarios.
	- Any given instant can be in one of the following states
		-   `REQUESTED` - Denotes an action has been scheduled, but has not initiated
		-   `INFLIGHT` - Denotes that the action is currently being performed
		-   `COMPLETED` - Denotes completion of an action on the timeline
