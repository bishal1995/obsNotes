Aggregates

Window functions : A window function makes a calculation across multiple rows that are related to the current row.Similar to an aggregate function (`GROUP BY`), a window function performs the operation across multiple rows. Unlike an aggregate function, a window function does not group rows into one single row. For eg
- Running total
- 7-day moving average.
- Rankings

Sample expression
```sql
  SELECT
    window_function() OVER(
         PARTITION BY partition_expression
         ORDER BY order_expression
         window_frame_extent
    ) AS window_column_alias
    FROM table_name
```

- Order By : It changes the basis on which the function assigns numbers to rows. For example, if we `ORDER BY` the expression `price` on an ascending order, then the lowest-priced item will have the lowest rank.
- Partition By : While the result of a `GROUP BY` aggregates all rows, the result of a window function using `PARTITION BY` aggregates each partition independently. Without the `PARTITION BY` clause, the result set is one single partition.
- Window Frame Extend : A window frame is the selected set of rows in the partition over which aggregation will occur. Put simply, they are a set of rows that are somehow related to the current row.A window frame is defined by a lower bound and an upper bound relative to the current row. The lowest possible bound is the first row, which is known as `UNBOUNDED PRECEDING`. The highest possible bound is the last row, which is known as `UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING`. For example, if we only want to get 5 rows before the current row, then we will specify the range using `5 PRECEDING`.

| Function Syntax    | Function Description                                                                       | Additional Notes                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ROW_NUMBER()`     | Assigns a sequential integer to each row within the partition of a result set.             | **Row numbers are not repeated** within each partition.                                                                                                                        |
| `RANK()`           | Assigns a rank number to each row in a partition.                                          | - Tied values are given the same rank.<br>- The next rankings are skipped.                                                                                                     |
| `DENSE_RANK()`     | Same as rank but , next rankings are not skipped                                           | [Example](https://www.naukri.com/code360/library/difference-between-rank-and-denserank)                                                                                        |
| `PERCENT_RANK()`   | Assigns the rank number of each row in a partition as a percentage.                        | - Tied values are given the same rank.<br>- Computed as the fraction of rows less than the current row, i.e., the rank of row divided by the largest rank in the partition.    |
| `NTILE(n_buckets)` | Distributes the rows of a partition into a specified number of buckets.                    | - For example, if we perform the window function NTILE(5) on a table with 100 rows, they will be in bucket 1, rows 21 to 40 in bucket 2, rows 41 to 60 in bucket 3, et cetera. |
| `CUME_DIST()`      | The cumulative distribution: the percentage of rows less than or equal to the current row. | - It returns a value larger than 0 and at most 1. <br>- Tied values are given the same cumulative distribution value.                                                          |
