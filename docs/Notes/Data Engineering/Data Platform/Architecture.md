Key Aspects Of Data Platform
* Enable self-service for a diverse range of users
	*  If someone wants to bring data into their work, they should be able to easily find the data they need.
		* Easily discover and analyze data within the platform
		* Understand the context associated with data, such as column descriptions, history and lineage
		* Derive insights from data with minimal dependencies on the data and Analytics Team
* Enable Agile Data Management
	* _Availability_: Data is already available in a data lake or warehouse. Modern data lakes and warehouses separate storage and compute, which makes it possible to store large amounts of data for relatively cheap.
	* _Elasticity_: Compute is based on a cloud platform, which allows for elasticity and auto-scalability. For example, if end users consume the most data and analytics on Friday afternoons, it should be possible to auto-scale processing power on Friday afternoon to give users a great experience and then scale down within a few hours.
